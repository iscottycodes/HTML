# CBC College HTML Assignment - Scott Dee

## Assignment Description

Hi! I'm Scott Dee, a CBC College student in the Web Development program. This is my HTML/CSS assignment for class. I picked a SpaceX theme because I think rockets are cool. This shows what I learned about HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap so far.

The website has a few main parts:
- A cool header with a space background
- An about section where I talk about the company
- Some info about space missions 
- A contact form
- A table with SpaceX data

I used Bootstrap to make it work on phones and tablets too.

## How to Set It Up

1. Download all the files
2. Double click on `index.html` to open it in your browser
3. That's it! No installation needed since Bootstrap loads from the internet

If you want to edit the files:
- Use any text editor like Notepad++ or VS Code
- The main file is `index.html` 
- All the styling is in `styles.css`
- Images are in the `images` folder

## How to Use

This is mostly just to look at and learn from, but here's how it works:

1. **Navigation** - Click the menu links at the top to jump to different sections
2. **Scroll** - The page scrolls smoothly between sections
3. **Contact Form** - Fill out the form (it checks if you entered everything)
4. **Mobile** - Try making your browser window smaller to see how it adapts

## What's in This Project

### Stuff I Added:
- **Responsive Design** - Works on computers, tablets, and phones
- **Cool Backgrounds** - Used SpaceX images as backgrounds
- **Bootstrap Cards** - Made neat looking content boxes
- **Table** - Added a table with SpaceX mission info
- **Contact Form** - Made a working form with validation
- **Hover Effects** - Things change when you mouse over them

### Technologies Used:
- HTML5 - The structure of the page
- CSS3 - All the styling and colors
- Bootstrap 5 - For responsive layout and components
- JavaScript - For scroll effects and form checking

### What Each Section Does:
- **Header** - Big space background with title and navigation
- **About** - Company info with the exact Lorem ipsum text I was given
- **Features** - Three cards showing different things about space tech
- **Missions Table** - A table with real SpaceX mission data
- **Contact** - A form to send messages (just for show)

## How I Made This

### My Process:
1. **Planning** - I drew out what I wanted the site to look like
2. **HTML** - I wrote all the structure first with proper tags
3. **CSS** - I added custom styling to make it look good
4. **Bootstrap** - I used classes to make it work on all screen sizes
5. **Testing** - I checked it in Chrome, Firefox, and on my phone

### What I Learned:
- How to use HTML5 semantic tags properly
- Place CSS animations and transitions
- Make responsive designs with Bootstrap grid
- Add JavaScript for interactions
- Structure a website with multiple sections

### Could Be Better:
- The contact form doesn't actually send emails (just shows an alert)
- Background images could be optimized better
- I could add more interactive stuff
- Some animations might be too slow on older computers

### Code Quality Stuff I Tried to Follow:
- Added comments to explain tricky parts
- Used consistent spacing (2 spaces for indenting)
- Named things clearly (like "hero-section" not just "header")
- Made sure it works without JavaScript (gradual enhancement)

## Contributing

I'm not really looking for contributors since this is a school project, but if you want to:
- Feel free to fork it and make your own version
- Let me know if you find any bugs
- You can use my code as an example for your own projects

## License

MIT License - basically means you can use this code for whatever you want, just maybe include my name if you copy a lot.
