# How to Contribute (If You Want To)

Hey! Since this is my CBC College assignment, it's mostly just for class work, but here's how you could help out or use my code.

## If You Want to Help

### What Kinds of Help I'd Accept:
- **Bug fixes** - if something doesn't work right
- **Better explanations** - if my comments are confusing
- **Accessibility improvements** - making it easier for disabled users
- **Mobile fixes** - if it doesn't work well on phones
- **Performance** - making it load faster

### How to Submit Changes:
1. **Fork the repo** (copy it to your GitHub)
2. **Make your changes** 
3. **Test them** - check that it still works in different browsers
4. **Write a clear message** about what you fixed
5. **Submit a pull request**

## Code Style

I tried to keep things simple and readable. Here's what I did:

### HTML:
```html
<!-- I used comments like this -->
<section class="my-section">
    <div class="container">
        <!-- content goes here -->
    </div>
</section>
```

### CSS:
```css
/* CSS comments look like this */
.my-class {
    /* Indent with 4 spaces */
    background-color: blue;
    margin: 10px;
}
```

### Things I Tried to Do:
- Use meaningful names (not random letters)
- Add comments for tricky parts
- Keep consistent spacing
- Make it work on phones too

## Making Changes

If you want to edit my code:

1. **Download the files**
2. **Edit in any text editor** (I used VS Code)
3. **Save and refresh your browser** to see changes
4. **Test on your phone** to make sure it still works

## Reporting Issues

If something's broken:
- Tell me what browser you're using
- Describe what you expected vs what happened
- Let me know if it's on phone or computer

## Using My Code

Feel free to:
- Copy parts for your own projects
- Learn from how I structured things
- Modify it for your assignments
- Share it with other students

Just maybe mention that Scott Dee wrote the original if you copy a lot of it.
